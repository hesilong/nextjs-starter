How to Set Up and Install Clawdbot (OpenClaw) on a Mac Mini

Setting up Clawdbot on a Mac mini is straightforward, and the same steps work on any Mac. The Mac mini is just a common choice because it is one of the most affordable macOS devices. If you prefer, you can also install Clawdbot on Windows via PowerShell.

Even if you do not code, you can finish this in a few minutes by following the steps below.

## 1. Install OpenClaw

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will download and set up everything automatically.

## 2. Run the setup wizard

Start onboarding:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

When you see the safety prompt, choose **Yes**:

```
I understand this is powerful and inherently risky. Continue?
```

## 3. Choose onboarding mode

Select **Quickstart** (recommended for first-time users).

## 4. Choose your model provider

Pick your preferred LLM provider. If you choose OpenAI, select **OpenAI API key**.

Create an API key at:

```
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

After pasting the key, select the model you want to use (the latest version is usually a good choice).

## 5. Choose a channel (messaging app)

Pick the app where you want to chat with Clawdbot. Use the arrow keys, then press Return to confirm.

If you choose WhatsApp, a QR code will appear. Scan it using the Linked Devices option in WhatsApp.

## 6. Configure skills

When prompted, select **Yes** to enable skills, then choose the skills you want Clawdbot to access.

## 7. Start using Clawdbot

Once setup finishes, message Clawdbot from your chosen channel. It will start executing commands on your Mac mini right away.
