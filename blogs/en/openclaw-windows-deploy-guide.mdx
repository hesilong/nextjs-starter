If you follow AI automation, you have probably seen OpenClaw everywhere lately.

In short, OpenClaw gives AI “hands” and “eyes,” turning chat-only agents into tools that can actually control a desktop. It is powerful, but Windows setup has enough details to discourage first-time users.

To make it “not only good, but easy to install,” here is a full configuration guide. From prerequisites to a successful run, the common pitfalls are marked. Let’s get started.

## 1. Prerequisites

OpenClaw depends on Node.js and Git. Install the following first.

### 1.1 Install Node.js (version ≥ 22)

1. Download: Visit the Node.js official website and choose “Windows Installer (64‑bit)” (.msi).
2. Install steps:
   - Double‑click the installer, accept the license, click “Next.”
   - Keep the default install path (`C:\Program Files\nodejs\`), click “Next.”
   - Key option: ensure “Add Node.js to PATH” is checked.
   - Keep defaults on the remaining pages and click “Install.”
3. Verify: restart PowerShell and run:

```bash
node -v
```

4. If the output is `v22.x.x` or higher, it is successful.

### 1.2 Install Git

Purpose: pull OpenClaw code and dependencies.

1. Download the 64‑bit Git installer from the official site.
2. Install with default options (environment variables are set automatically).
3. Verify:

```bash
git --version
```

4. If a version is printed, it is successful.

### 1.3 Allow PowerShell scripts

Windows blocks scripts by default. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Type `Y` to confirm.

## 2. Install the OpenClaw core program

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the official one‑line installer:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://clawd.bot/install.ps1 | iex
```

Wait for “Clawdbot installed successfully.”

## 3. Run the onboarding wizard

Start the wizard:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

Recommended choices:

### 3.1 Mode

Options: QuickStart / Advanced  
Meaning:
- QuickStart: auto‑configures basic settings, best for beginners.
- Advanced: custom models/ports, for advanced users.

Recommendation: choose QuickStart.

### 3.2 Provider

Options: Qwen / OpenAI / Skip for now  
Meaning: choose your model provider.

Recommendation: Qwen (works well in mainland China); you will authorize via browser.

### 3.3 Default model

Option: qwen-portal/coder-model  
Meaning: the default model OpenClaw uses.

Recommendation: keep default.

### 3.4 Channels

Options: Telegram / WhatsApp / Skip for now  
Meaning: choose chat platforms for OpenClaw.

Recommendation: Skip for now (defaults are overseas platforms).

### 3.5 Skills

Options: Yes / No  
Meaning: enable core skills (file ops, code execution, etc.).

Recommendation: Yes.

### 3.6 Skill install

Options: npm / pnpm / bun  
Meaning: package manager for skill dependencies.

Recommendation: npm (best compatibility, easy to mirror in China).

### 3.7 Skill dependencies

Options: Skip for now / choose dependencies  
Meaning: some skills require overseas services.

Recommendation: Skip for now, install locally later as needed.

### 3.8 API keys

Options: No / Yes  
Meaning: configure third‑party API keys (e.g., Google Maps).

Recommendation: No (not accessible in China).

### 3.9 Hooks

Options: Skip for now / Enable  
Meaning: automation triggers requiring tokens.

Recommendation: Skip for now.

## 4. Start the gateway service

```bash
openclaw gateway start
```

## 5. Open the admin UI

Visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:18789
```

## 6. China‑friendly channel: Feishu

Feishu is officially supported in China. Steps:

1. Create an “enterprise self‑built app” on the Feishu developer platform.
2. Get App ID and App Secret.
3. Edit `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.openclaw\openclaw.json`, add:

```json
"channels": {
  "feishu": {
    "enabled": true,
    "appId": "YOUR_APP_ID",
    "appSecret": "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
    "connectionMode": "websocket"
  }
}
```

4. Restart the gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

5. After restart, you can interact with OpenClaw via Feishu.
